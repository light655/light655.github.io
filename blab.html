<h2>(2026/01/14)</h2>
<p>When I was converting my website into the new format, I found that the test I conducted on the 74HC595 was flawed.
There are two problems with that test.</p>
<p>The first is that I only loaded one of the output of the 74HC595.
Since this IC is typically used to drive a parallel bus of LEDs, I think that I should load all 8 outputs instead.</p>
<p>The second is that the Kelvin connection for measuring current was incorrect.
The goal of Kelvin connection is to <em>only measure the voltage across the resistor</em>.
When the larger current during measurement flows through the lead (drawn in red) resistance and breadboard contact resistance,
a voltage will develop and the voltage at the lower end of the resistor will be slightly higher than 0V.
By connecting probe (or amplifier in this case) in parallel to the resistor by the soldered second lead of the resistor (drawn in green), we can remove this voltage error from the measurement.</p>
<p><em>So, what went wrong?</em>
I shouldn't connect the crossed out black wire from the probe point to ground,
because it will introduce current flow through this black wire and thus the second lead of the resistor will carry a larger portion of current.
This means that the Kelvin connection I made is basically useless.
However, with the 10Ω resistance during testing, Kelvin connection is probably overkill in the first place.
Therefore, the test result is still pretty accurate (<em>as long as you are only using one of the output</em>).</p>

<p>I am planning on doing a test with all 8 outputs loaded, stay tuned!</p>
